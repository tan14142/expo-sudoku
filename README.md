## Running the App Locally

To run the app on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window on your computer and navigate to the directory where you want to store the app.
2. Clone the repository by typing the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tan14142/expo-sudoku.git
   ```

3. Open Visual Studio Code and select "Open Folder". Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and select it.
4. Open a new terminal window in Visual Studio Code by selecting "Terminal" from the top menu and choosing "New Terminal".
5. In the terminal window, type the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This command will download and install the dependencies needed to run the app.

6. Once the dependencies have been installed, you can use one of the following commands to start the app:

   ```
   npm run start
   ```

   This command will start the Expo development server, which will allow you to run the app on an emulator or on your own device.

   ```
   npm run android
   ```

   This command will start the Expo development server and launch the app on an Android emulator.

   ```
   npm run ios
   ```

   This command will start the Expo development server and launch the app on an iOS simulator.

   ```
   npm run web
   ```

   This command will start the Expo development server and launch the app in a web browser.

7. Once you have an emulator set up, select "Run on Android device/emulator" in the Expo developer tools that appear in your browser when you ran one of the commands above. This will start the app on the emulator.

8. If you want to run the app on your own device, install the Expo app from the app store on your device. Once you have installed the Expo app, scan the QR code that appears in the Expo developer tools to open the app on your device.

That's it! You should now be able to run the Sudoku app on an emulator or on your own device.
